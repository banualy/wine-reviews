# Wine Reviews Data Analysis and Regression Model

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and builds a regression model to predict wine review points based on features like price, region, and description sentiment. The analysis leverages Python libraries and Kaggle's Wine Reviews dataset.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Removes irrelevant or redundant columns, handles missing values.
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Maps average price and squared points to respective regions.
  - Extracts sentiment polarity from wine descriptions using `TextBlob`.
- **Visualization**: Correlation heatmaps and pairplots to uncover relationships between features.
- **Regression Modeling**: Uses linear regression to predict wine review points.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates model using RMSE and R-squared scores.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Required Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, textblob, scikit-learn, tensorflow

### Steps in the Script
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Drops unused columns like `designation`, `country`, and others.
   - Handles missing values by dropping rows with null values.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Calculates average squared points per region.
   - Uses `TextBlob` to compute sentiment polarity of descriptions.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Plots correlations using heatmaps and pairplots.

4. **Regression Model**:
   - Scales features using `StandardScaler`.
   - Splits data into training and testing sets.
   - Fits a linear regression model to predict wine points.

### Output
- The script prints:
  - Dataset summary statistics.
  - Correlation matrix.
  - Regression model performance (RMSE and R-squared scores).

## Example Results
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: 1.5 (approx.)
- **RÂ² Score**: 0.77 (approx.)
